# BioStructBenchmark

TODO: A tool for identifying the differences between two sets of structures, in particular DNA-protein complexes.
Built primarily for identifying systematic differences between experimentally determined structures and computationally
predicted structures generated by programs such as alphafold3.

Incorporates:

-Structure Alignment
-RMSD calculation and decomposition
-consensus error mapping (for working with datasets featuring incidental mutations)
-Principal Component Analysis
-DNA Geometry Analysis using CURVES+
## Installation

## Development

To install BioStructBenchmark for development, run:
`pip install -e BioStructBenchmark .[dev]'
